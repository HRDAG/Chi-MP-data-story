    "\n",
    "According to the Illinois Intergovernmental Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984, the primary contact agency (in the case of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department) is to enter every missing persons report into the Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS) for the purpose of effecting an immediate law enforcement response to reports of missing children, as well as to compile and retain information regarding missing children and the circumstances that led to their missingness and recovery. This historic data repository was written into law so that it could provide a factual and statistical base for research which would enable a deeper understanding and addressing of the problem of missing children in Illinois. Also in support of this research goal, law enforcement are required to update cases to reflect and include information relating to the final disposition of each case, but Chicago police do not enforce this practice in a way that is transparent or reproducible by experts at HRDAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of a legislative body's intentions in tasking an agency with data collection, many of the agency's own internal objectives can shape what that data collection looks like in practice, and thus the limitations of the dataset on statistical analyses. When it comes to the status field and tracking the \"Closed Non-Criminal\" label, there could be many organizational interests at play:\n",
    "- Middle management may want to use it as a flag to track active work assignments in order to manage workloads.\n",
    "- Management (or oversight agencies) might want to be able to identify poor performing staff before they become a larger liability.\n",
    "- Police unions might push back against additional tracking for the same reason as any labor organization would want to protect its members from additional employer surveillance, which in this case means avoiding the kind of accountability implied in the previous point.\n",
    "- Some of the agency leadership along with the political interests who appoint them have an interest in being able to influence or manipulate public opinion towards more trust and reliance on police."

    "### Exploratory analysis found discrepancies in the data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"discrepancies\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team almost immediately identified two cases which were classified as closed non-criminal even though a murder investigation was opened for the missing individual. After two years and reviewing all available case records for several dozen widely-reported on missing persons from 2000-2022, we were able to identify a total of 11 cases which were classified as \"Closed Non-criminal\" even though a homicide case had been opened for the missing, including 1 where the CPD Homicide case is explicitly mentioned in the request to reclassify the missing person report as non-criminal. We were also able to identify 4 cases in which the Chicago Police closed the missing persons case before the person was found – including two cases where the Black teenage girl was subsequently found murdered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not the only group to review CPD's record-keeping and encounter problems. In the past, CPD was investigated by the DOJ for several things. In a section of the [2017 DOJ report](https://www.justice.gov/d9/chicago_police_department_findings.pdf) from the investigation, titled, “CPD Does Not Provide Officers With Sufficient Direction, Supervision, or Support to Ensure Lawful and Effective Policing”, the data collection and public transparency methods were deemed \"insufficient\" by the DOJ. The section further revealed information about the poor usability and interoperability of **CPD's** software systems that contributed to our understanding of the internal data generation process in place for the first two-thirds of the record-keeping period. During our investigation, II also received information that CPD personnel influenced the design of some of their data entry system to discourage the use of structured fields and things like drop-down menus, at a cost to the ease of both data entry and producing summary statistics from the data. This design choice explained how some of the data entry errors we found, like the more than two dozen age values between 133 and 985 years old, or the year of birth recorded as \"1776\", were possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our attempt to reproduce CPD's prior statistic that 99.9% of those reported missing were located, we were unable to identify any structured field maintaining this information. After following up with the responding FOIA officer, we were told to use the field that indicates the status of the investigation as Open or Closed and Criminal or Non-criminal. However, as we have already stated and will discuss further with examples in the Record Linkage section, the labels in the status field (particularly \"Closed Non-criminal\") can be a misleading characterization of the ground truth and have been applied to cases where the missing person faced a gruesome outcome rather than a safe return home. We hope this notebook will demonstrate the flaw in using the status field to fill in information about the outcomes of missing persons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will introduce the datasets, our initial goals and questions, and the discrepancies we found between the data and ground truth outcomes. The next chapter will be on the events surrounding a missing persons event, including 911 calls, officer arrival, case closure, the UCR code, and a sneak peak of analysis involving missing person 911 calls and ShotSpotter dispatches. The next two will be on who is represented in the data and described in most reports, and then who is not represented in the data and the real-world circumstances that lead to someone being fully excluded from this kind of data collection."

    "2. **CPD** maintains a more complete narrative of the outcome in the unstructured case files, specifically Supplementary Reports, that need to be requested in small batches and cannot be reviewed as a large collection. Unless CPD has a structured database available in other internal software which is not subject to FOIA requests, it's likely the true number of located persons is buried in a collection of tens or hundreds of thousands of paper and digital Supp reports that would need be read individually to determine whether they describe a missing person who was later located. For cases which have no Supp reports to review but are labeled \"Closed Non-Criminal\", it's unclear what details from the investigation were used to justify the closure and whether the missing was located."

    "***What happens when a case which was initially classified as a missing person is to be reclassified as related to a crime?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on legislation, Detectives are required to reclassify the missing persons case as a crime if they have knowledge that a crime occured. A case can be reclassified in two ways: 1) through a supplementary report or 2) a change in UCR, when reclassification rationale is supported by information in the case report.\n",
    "\n",
    "By directives, CPD doesn't collect structured data indicating whether or not a person was located -- rather they track if the case was criminally associated or not. The status of the case indicates if an offender was identified or charged and the current IUCR column provides the crime associated with the incident. In this way, \"Closed Non-criminal\" means that no crime and no offender were identified by the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few cases that were officially reclassified – indicating that the reclassification rationale was supported by information in the case report. It includes two adult women and one missing child.\n",
    "- Daisy Hayes, who has never been found but her case was reclassified as a homicide when evidence was discovered that implicated her boyfriend in her disappearance. He was charged with her murder and her case status reflects cleared closed.\n",
    "- Joanna Wright, who has never been found, but witness and vehicle evidence indicated she was kidnapped. Her case has been suspended and was reclassified as a kidnapping.\n",
    "- Marlen Ochoa Lopez, a missing pregnant teen, whose body was found in a garbage can after her disappearance. Two women were charged in her murder. Her case is cleared closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***What would a missing person being located safely look like in this data?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Chicago Police Department doesn't track whether or not a person was located, it cannot identify such cases among those that may have been prematurely closed before the missing was located and/or incorrectly classified as not related to a crime. There is no direct indicator for the recovery of a missing person."

    "Record linkage refers to the process of programmatically linking co-referent records within a collection and de-duplicating them, so that there's one row per unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the identifier is associated with a unique incident, then this sets up the data for incident-level analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where possible, we try to organize the data so that there's one row per unique _person_. We take a hash value of the content that refers to the same person and use the value as an \"entity\" id to represent the group of co-referent records. This preserves the option to inspect the grouped, person-level data later on. However, person-level analysis is not always feasible, especially with anonymized datasets like the CPD MP records. There, we will only be able to link to an MP report via an `rd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work at HRDAG, Entity Resolution usually involves combining prepared lists we receive from different sources that contain names of humans who have been killed in a violent conflict. We use the structured information about overlaps between sources with other statistical techniques like [multiple systems estimation, or MSE](https://hrdag.org/2013/03/11/mse-the-basics/). We hope to enable MSE because of the data limitations stated above; we know that some people are more likely to be documented than others and we want to use all available tools to estimate how many people are missing from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the OEMC and CPD records were not anonymous, then we could do Entity Resolution across these databases and perform person-level analysis of outcomes where the missing person was ultimately found deceased. Where possible, we could trace reports that began as a 911 call to OEMC to their CPD report, and later ME record. Or, focus on the CPD and ME overlaps to study the rates of missing persons later found deceased and how these reports are classified by CPD. However, as already stated, we won't be able to do that kind of record linkage here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data generated by humans and on human rights abuses is often imprecise, so we develop and evaluate our record linkage techniques to make sure they are as robust and flexible as they can be reliable. We won't go into much detail on it in this notebook, but here is a [blogpost series that dives into part of this framework](https://hrdag.org/2016/01/08/a-geeky-deep-dive-database-deduplication-to-identify-victims-of-human-rights-violations/) and a [demonstrative workflow](https://github.com/HRDAG/training-docs/tree/main/demo-tasks/record-linkage) for more information."

    "### Linking MP Reports <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"report-linkage\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "All CPD databases share an `rd` field that can be used to identify records relating to the same unique and original report. In fact, it's outlined in a policy from the 1980s that original reports should be re-classified and updated with new information about the underlying events to support research and analysis later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's likely that the Illinois Task Force for Missing and Murdered Chicago Women expected to use the City's data and reclassifications accordingly to analyze the outcomes of reports as promised by law. However, virtually all of the MP records have their original classification, so there would be an extremely limited sample of outcomes to study on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the UCR code field, there are only 10 examples a MP report being reclassified to a Homicide out of more than 350,000 reports made over more than 20 years. The Missing Persons Investigation team reviewed the full case files of a couple dozen reports and identified another 11 examples of a missing person who was found to be the victim of a homicide - doubling the official total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the unique id fields in the datasets here. CPD uses an `rd`, OEMC uses an `eventnumber`, the ME uses a `casenumber`. We expect co-referent records across the datasets, but these id fields are distinct and won't get us those linkages. We could try another approach using names but those are not included in the CPD MP data or the OEMC records, so we might only have productive matches from the CPD Homicide and ME databases, which we know to have dependent data generation processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning of the project, there didn't appear to be a productive avenue for analyzing report outcomes. But as II and CB conducted interviews and reviewed widely publicized cases, CPD `rd`s and ME `casenumber`s were revealed for a sample of cases originating as missing persons reports with known present-day outcomes. This enabled investigators to review the unstructured data in CPD case files, along with the structured MP data and, when the missing person had been found deceased, the Homicide and ME data. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) was also checked for certain instances where the person is still considered missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the sample of a couple dozen cases, we found discrepancies between the \"NON-CRIMINAL\" classification and ground truth events. We present 4 of the 11 homicide cases we identified. These cases allow us a deeper insight into the missing person pipeline and some underlying issues related to missing children in Chicago."

Interviews with her family and underlying records show that she had an unstable living situation, was struggling with bi-polar disorder, and was groomed by an older man. There were several sightings of Takaylah during the 2 weeks before her murder. Police reports show, when detectives reached out to Takaylah's friends they learned she began getting beaten by a man the day after she ran away from the facility and wanted to return.\n",

When she was found, she was a Jane Doe. Law enforcement in Chicago put out a missing person alert for Takaylah on September 25 -- over a week after her body had been found.**"

    "(2002) Chavanna Prather was a 17 year old basketball player who worked at a local Mcdonalds; she was three months pregnant at the time she went missing. She had been reported missing a couple weeks before that and the reports noted that she was having trouble getting along with her mother’s house rules. She was [last seen](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24399380-chavannaprather_hh320286) on April 19, 2002, leaving work with her manager, Tony Fountain, a man nearly twice her age with whom she had been intimate. According to [court records](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Resources/4c607a0b-7df9-4124-af3b-0a95b64c6d5c/1103312_R23.pdf), she was murdered that night. The same records reveal that while he had Chavanna in the trunk of his car, he texted a friend – “I shot that bitch. She wouldn't die.”\n",

This report was approved by [Lt. Carol McLaurin](https://cpdp.co/officer/18379/carol-mc-laurin/) at 3:17pm that day.**"

    "Misspelled names plague the city datasets. Chavanna's name is spelled 3 different ways across media, CPD, and County ME data sources. For [Sadaria Davis](https://www.missinginillinois.org/post/shantieya-smith-sadaria-davis-2018-serial-killer-chicago-cook-county-illinois), another widely reported missing person who became the victim of a homicide, the CPD Homicide record has her first name as 'Sandra'. Data entry errors like these are why we adapt our record linkage processes to include possible pairs between databases that don't match on full name, but do on a combination of other features like age and last seen year/month. However, it's easy to imagine a busy officer or reviewer checking for a case by exact name in one or several of these databases, and in this context, a hasty data entry error combined with a hasty search would lead to a false belief that the missing person you're looking for had not been found deceased.\n",
    "\n",
    "All 4 of the underage Black girls whose stories we examined closely above have \"CLOSED NON-CRIMINAL\" as their missing persons case `status`, demonstrating how this field is not synonmous with a missing person being located and in fact has been applied to cases where the missing was found and had been murdered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the final supplementary report where an officer requests to close Jahmeshia Conner's missing person case and mark it \"Non-criminal\", he states that the missing had been located in an alley and positively identified by the Medical Examiner, and even includes the `rd` number for the CPD Homicide case. In reading this report, **there is no room to claim that CPD did not have knowledge that Jahmeshia had been murdered at the time of closing her missing person case and classifying it as \"Non-criminal\" or \"Incident not criminal in nature.\"** The request was approved just 8 minutes after being submitted to a supervisor.\n",
    "- Takaylah Tribbit's missing persons case was closed as \"Non-criminal\" on July 30, 2020, almost [9 months after she had been identified as a gunshot victim](https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-courts/teen-found-dead-in-gary-alley-was-reported-missing-by/article_50ae1147-b37f-501b-935d-d8c23071737e.html) in Indiana. In articles published at the time she was identified, Chicago police are reported as acknowledging that she had been missing since September. So, **how could CPD lack knowledge in July 2020 that she had been the victim of a crime?**\n",
    "- While her friend called around to find her, the police closed Desiree's missing persons case two weeks after reporting arrival to it, citing a conversation with the complainant in which they said she had been located. **Desiree's relatives have contradicted the police narrative that she returned home between when she went missing and when her body was found.**\n",
    "- Police records claim an officer spoke with the complainant days after the initial missing persons report for Chavanna and they related that she had been located at a friend's house. **How is that possible if court records show she was killed the night she went missing?**\n",
    "    - Here is the timeline of April 26th, 2002, the day Chavanna's body was found and her missing persons case closed:\n",
    "        - At 2:06pm an officer submits a case supp report to close her missing persons case, citing a conversation with complainant.\n",
    "        - At 4pm, the Medical Examiner creates the death report.\n",
    "        - At 4:20pm, CPD reports an officer arriving to the report of her homicide. The homicide case has a different `rd` number and there is nothing in her missing persons report to connect it to the homicide case, other than her misspelled name and presumably the case details in the unstructured reports.\n",
    "        - The time of homicide in CPD's records is 5pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hindsight includes criminal convictions for the persons responsible for Desiree and Chavanna's murders, and these are surely the kind of cases that the 1984 Missing Child Recovery Act was intended to enable the study and prevention of.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when \"CLOSED NON-CRIMINAL\" is used in cases like these that did in fact involve criminal events, the label loses its meaning _and_ functionally severs the connection to those related events and outcomes that would otherwise be included in the study. As a result, using the `status` field to respond to questions about real-world outcomes would be inconsistent with the ground truth for at least these cases. The true prevalence of this misclassification in other cases can only be discovered through systematic review of all CPD case materials and, most crucially, interviews with complainants and other stakeholders who may have different information than what is presented in police narratives."

    "\n",
    "Law enforcement is often the agency with the most contact with vulnerable populations who are likely to go missing – whether people are dealing with mental health issues, substance use abuse disorder, domestic violence, or human trafficking. They generate the data that public officials and researchers lean on to come to conclusions about violence prevention and addressing crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a comparison of law enforcement operating manuals, Illinois legislation, and CPD data, we have seen the disconnect that can come between a policy and its implementation. What’s most dangerous about this is the use of the data by officials higher in the chain who may not realize the disconnect between the data workers, policy, and law enforcement, and take its presentation at face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the state initially crafted a policy around missing persons cases, they were hoping to provide a factual and statistical base for research that would address the problem of missing people in Illinois. However, the information we can learn today about two decades of missing persons cases in Chicago is extremely limited given that the core `status` field is not reliable and no structured fields contain outcome information. The state Taskforce for Missing and Murdered Chicago Women would be able to more easily examine and report underlying patterns related to missing persons and make effective suggestions for violence prevention, as it was created to do, if Chicago Police reclassified and closed cases in a reliable and transparent way that reflects the ground truth of what happened. Instead, that information about the outcomes of the more than 350,000 reports accepted by CPD since January 1, 2000, is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This legislative body can still work to examine the records, but will need to keep data quality issues in mind during their exercise. Although we can’t learn about the outcome of all the cases en masse, we can provide stakeholders with the limited information we can gather from the datasets, such as rates of officer arrival, case closure, distribution of cases by race/age/sex of missing, the implications of shotspotter on case priority, and a few others things we will present in subsequent notebooks."

    "Systematically identifying still-missing humans and other types of misclassification for an audit of the MP data would involve a review of underlying case materials, as well as crucial interviews and statements from complainants. Without funding and community participation to conduct that expansive review, the information about those case outcomes is lost as these instances can't be distinguished from reports that were closed appropriately using the structured data alone. With labeled training data that represents the true outcome of say, 1,000 cases in the database, we may be able to develop a machine learning model that can classify the remainder of the case data. This would involve a robust review process to evaluate and improve the classification accuracy, and may be most useful as a tool for suggesting which cases are most likely to have been misclassified and should be reviewed further by a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we could analyze the case outcomes where the reported missing person was ultimately found deceased within the county because there should be a record in the ME data in such cases. To do this, we need the unredacted MP data that includes full names of the missing humans to make identifications between databases possible. Connections between the two databases does not strictly imply that a missing person became deceased while missing, but other databases such as NamUs, as well as media reports and family interviews, can help fill in the timeline and those details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of what analysis the Task Force and other community stakeholders are interested in, the discrepancies in CPD's records presented in this notebook will continue to be possible without intervention, and could affect any of the, on average, dozens of new reports received by CPD on a daily basis."
