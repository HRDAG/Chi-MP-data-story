# 'Missing in Chicago' data story
This public repo is a resource for the ['Missing in Chicago'](chicagomissingpersons.com/) story by Trina Reynolds-Tyler and Sarah Conway.

Included are the processed data files built from the raw files received through FOIA requests.

# dataset
The dataset used in this repo is an export from a private parent repo, HRDAG/US-II-MP, which takes a collection of documents received through FOIA requests as input and builds a formatted table to use for analysis. As the investigation is ongoing, the data in that parent repo continues into 2023 and includes an expanding list of features, but here we limit the dataset to 1 January 2000 - 31 December 2022 and features we intend to include in analysis.
